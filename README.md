## Requirements / Purpose

-   The aim of this project was to demonstrate my competency with Firestore and React by building a mock e-commerce platform that fetched all of it's product data from a Firebase database.

- At a minimum your e-shop website should have two pages:

- Home Page
  - This will contain:
    - A Grid of products
    - Carousel of featured products
    - Product Page (with id parameter) Similar to a product page on another site, allows you to add to cart and select product variants
- All products should be stored in Firestore:
  - You should store the following information:
    - quantity
    - variants (could be colors, sizes, etc)
    - price per unit
    - name
    - image url
    - favourited or not (boolean)
      All data should be stored in Firestore and fetched by the frontend, there should be NO static product data in the react application
